version 1.30
- date: 24-06-2025
- fix CRC stop bit during SD card initialization - contributed by Vincent Riviere
  this adds support for recent cards, including SDHC and SDXC with large capacity


version 1.20
- date: 28-01-2014
- some small fixes were made to the SCSI part of the code to better comply with the
  SCSI standard - fixed after more non-compliance reports from Uwe Seimet
- time out handling in the SD / MMC part of the code was bit remade - now you shouldn't
  have the device stuck in card initialization process even when the card doesn't
  cooperate with US (it happened from time to time, or on some weird cards)


version 1.13
- last change in the new revision made on 2013-05-01 according to info from
  Uwe Seimet (HDDRIVER author) on what's wrong and what should behave differently
- changed (fixed) the Additional Sense Code for device when card is not present to
  0x3a (MEDIUM_NOT_PRESENT)
- removed the dynamic UltraSatan device name in Inquiry SCSI command, because it caused
  some issues with HDDRIVER, now the SD card slots are always displayed as UltraSatan 1
  and UltraSatan 2 no matter what card is inserted
- now replying with CHECK CONDITION and MEDIUM NOT PRESENT also on READ CAPACITY command
- when card is changed, UltraSatan now returns NOT_READY_TO_READY_TRANSITION as
  additional sense code - this is what other removable devices do and what
  HDDRIVER checks for
- returning now VENDOR (JOOKIE) and DEVICE NAME (UltraSatan), so when scanned for device,
  it will now look like 'JOOKIE UltraSatan 1' and 'JOOKIE UltraSatan 2'
- response to INQUIRY now returns also firmware version and firmware date,
  so HDDRIVER / HDDRUTIL can read and show this info

version 1.05

- TT fix done by not checking RnW when finished reading data
- SCSI_Verify added - now can verify data after write on ST
