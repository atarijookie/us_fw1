How to flash the new firmware to UltraSatan
-------------------------------------------


1. Copy the 'us_conf.prg'
   (from http://joo.kie.sk/ultrasatan/download/config.zip)
   and us*.ldr
   (from http://joo.kie.sk/ultrasatan/download/us_fw.zip)
   to a floppy disk.

2. Connect your UltraSatan to ATARI, start as usual

3. Start the 'us_conf.prg' from floppy and it will find your UltraSatan

4. Move down in the 'Firmware list' using arrows to some position
   (please note that you can't upload new firmware to the position
   of base firmware)

5. Press the 'u' key and a file selection dialog will appear

6. Find the *.ldr file on the floppy (A:) and press 'OK'

7. Press the 'r' key to refresh the 'Firmware list' and the
   newly uploaded firmware will appear.

8. Move to the new firmware by arrows and press space to select it.

9. Press 'w' to write these new settings to your UltraSatan.

10. Turn off the ST and UltraSatan.

11. When you turn on your ST and UltraSatan again, it should be
    running the new firmware. You can check it by starting the
    us_conf.prg again and by watching the firmware version string
    (when it finds your UltraSatan, it will write something like
    'Firmware: UltraSatan v1.05 (by Jookie)' )

Please note, that if you are uploading the new firmware to fix some
bug related to the communication with your Atari, you should do it
on a machine which doesn't have that problem, i.e. if you are
fixing the communication with TT issue, upload the firmware from ST.
